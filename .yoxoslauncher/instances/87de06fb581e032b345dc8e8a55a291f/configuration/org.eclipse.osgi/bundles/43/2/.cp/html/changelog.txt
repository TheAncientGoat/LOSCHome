General:
- IMPORTANT: The email & password authentication has been replaced by a 
  license key. You can get a license key free of charge by clicking on 
  "Get License Key" in the Profiles View 

Profiles View:
- Saved Profiles are now stored online, so that you can access them from
  any Eclipse Installation (after log-in into your account)
- Saved Profiles can be made "publicly visible" and shared with other 
  Yoxos users.
- The Profiles View shows your profiles and all public profiles. 
- With the Customize Profiles action you can save additional information
  with a profile (Team Project Set, Mylyn Metadata).

  with a question mark next to them.
- The Scenario View has been replaced by the Profiles View.

Plug-In Explorer:
- The Plug-In Explorer has a search-as-you-type filter

Changes between 2.3.0 and 3.3.0

- The "Features" node in the Inspector view now expands faster.
- Search will only begin for terms that are at least three characters long. 
- Distribution content is now cached locally. This should improve the time

Note: this version is no longer compatible with Eclipse 3.2.


Changes between 2.2.7 and 2.2.8

- Missing subscription data can now be entered during the installation process. 
- Added a "Get Eclipse 3.3" action. This action provides a custom archive with
  Eclipse 3.3 and your features (as long as they are part of the Yoxos 
  distribution). It will be enabled in June.
- Added an "Update All" action to the "update indicator" context menu.
  This action will automatically update all features for which updates are
  available.

Changes between 2.2.4 and 2.2.5

- The handling of YIM updates and updates to the Yoxos Feature Descriptions has 
  been re-worked:
    * Notifications about new updates are no longer in a modal dialog that
      blocks user interaction, but are displayed in a 'speech bubble'.
      Clicking the speech bubble opens the Update Dialog.
    * If an update to the YIM is available, the Update Dialog shows now
      the changelog in advance to the installation.
    * When a Feature Description update is available, the table of added, 
      removed and updated features is displayed. It has now a number of filters
      for selectively hiding added, removed, updated and secondary features.
    * You can now choose to have Feature Description updates installed
      automatically when they are available. The Yoxos Network Settings
      Preference Page has a setting for this.
- You can now directly check your user name, password and subscription
  status on the Preference Page where you enter your data.
- SDK features are now also automatically selected as source features.
- Fixed a bug that spoiled the colors of the splash screen on Linux.
- Fixed a bug that ignored Feature Description updates when no initial Feature
  Descriptions were installed (uncommon case).
- Fixed a bug in the startup code that caused some error messages
  (uncommon case).
- Fixed a bug in the Inspector View that could occur when running on Java 1.6.


Changes between 2.2.3 and 2.2.4

- After finishing an installation, it is now possible to choose when Eclipse 
  is restarted.
- Added an automatic update-reminder that is shown if the update attempt was
  more than two months ago. 
- It is possible to clear all "Do not show again" settings and show all hidden
  dialogs again (under Window > Preferences > Yoxos > General).
- Commercial features will be decorated with a $-icon in all YIM Views.
- The confirmation dialog for feature requirements will now show the names of
  of the required features.
- Inspector View:
  * added an "Add To Schedule" action to the context menu
  * it is possible to copy the path of an installation from the 
    Inspector View into the clipboard via the context menu
  * preferences are sorted alphabetically in the "Preference Customization"
    action (accessible from the Inspector View)
- Search View:
    * drag-and-drop support from the Search View into the Schedule
    * The "Show in Medium Explorer" will also work with filtered-out features
- The Schedule View will now show the download size when first opened.
- Several minor user interface improvements.


Changes between 2.2.2 and 2.2.3

- The internal mechanics for accessing distribution content have been improved,
  especially the case where the distribution content is located offline on a
  DVD has been significantly sped up.
- The status line contains an "update indicator" that uses different icons
  to signal that features in the current Eclipse installation can be updated.
  Clicking on the indicator will list all updatable features in the
  Medium Explorer.


Changes between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2

- In the Schedule View, features that have been explicitely selected for
  installation (as opposed to features that have been automatically added
  as dependency) are now shown in bold font.
- Features, feature groups and scenarios can be added by Drag-and-Drop to
  the Schedule; they can be dragged from the Medium Explorer, the Scenarios
  View and the Inspector View.
- In the Info View, there is now a toolbar button that opens a web browser
  on the homepage of the project which provides that feature (if applicable).
- On the Inspector View's view menu there is a new item for creating a
  preference customization out of the settings in the current Eclipse
  installation. It can be used to generate key-value pairs suitable to
  insert into a preference customization for an Eclipse-based product.


Changes between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1

- The YIM offers now the possibility to switch to the 'Milestone stream' of
  Yoxos releases.

  Updates of the Yoxos distribution content are available in two different
  streams: the 'Release Stream' and the 'Milestone Stream'. The latter
  contains the Stable Builds (also known as 'Milestones') from the Eclipse
  project plus other software in development or early-access versions.

  Starting with this version of the YIM, the Install Manager can be pointed
  to the Milestone Stream. The software from the Milestone Stream is then
  available for installation and update.

  Please note that this step cannot be reversed! Any later updates to the Yoxos
  distribution content will always be taken from the Milestone Stream, until
  the next Release from the Eclipse project, which happens once a year,
  usually in late June. At the time of that release, the Yoxos Release Stream
  and the Yoxos Milestone Stream converge and it will be possible again to
  choose between the two streams.

  Note further that this step is taken per Eclipse installation. It is
  possible to maintain different Eclipse installations (including the YIM)
  where each of them may or may not be switched to the Milestone Stream.

  There is a menu item on the Medium Explorer' view menu for switching to
  the Milestone Stream.

- Keyboard shortcuts and context menus have been added for deleting a user-
  defined scenario in the Scenarios View and deleting entries in the Search
  View.
- The Search View has a new filter that allows to hide secondary features
  (e.g. source features and language pack features). The filter can be switched
  on and off from the toolbar on the Search View.
- Features can be sorted alphabetically in the Scenarios View.
- Several bugfixes in dependency handling and the installation routines.


Changes between 2.1.4 and 2.2.0

- The Yoxos Install Manager requires now Eclipse 3.2 or higher.
- There is a new View in the YIM Perspective: the Inspector.

  The Inspector View shows the features that are currently installed in the
  Eclipse installation. It distinguishes between features that are known in
  the Yoxos distribution and features that are not known, and displays different
  icons in each case. For features known in the distribution, the Inspector
  indicates whether the currently installed version can be updated to a newer
  version of the same feature.

  On the Inspector, a different Eclipse installation than the one that is
  currently running can be selected. This installation can be inspected, and
  it is possible to install features into that installation.

  The Inspector can be filtered so that it shows only features that can be
  updated.

- Installation cloning: from the Inspector View, it is possible to create
  a new Eclipse installation that contains exactly the features that are
  installed in the current Eclipse installation (in their latest versions
  from the Yoxos distribution).
- The Medium Explorer has a new filter that allows to hide secondary features
  (e.g. source features and language pack features). These features are still
  automatically selected if the Autoselector checkboxes are checked, but they
  are no longer shown in the tree on the Medium Explorer. The filter can be
  switched off on the Medium Explorer's toolbar.
- The Medium Explorer can distinguish between "already installed" and
  "updatable" features and use different icons in those cases.
- The YIM now contributes several items to the Eclipse Intro.
- There is now a new Cheatsheet that explains the most important UI elements
  in the YIM Perspective.
- There is a new wizard for importing scenarios. The new wizard allows a
  more fine-grained selection from the contents of the imported scenario file.
- Introduced a new Autoselector for automatically adding NLS2a language pack
  features.
- If a group is selected in the Medium Explorer, the context menu (right-click)
  contains now an item 'Expand this', which fully expands the selected subtree,
  starting at the selected folder.
- YIM does now detect when it is running in an Eclipse that is in development
  mode ('Runtime workbench'). In this mode, the YIM performs no update checks
  and no Update dialog is opened.
- Fixed a problem that resulted in a miscalculation of the download size for
  features selected in the Medium Explorer.
- Several smaller bugfixes.


Changes between 2.1.3 and 2.1.4

- Additional toolbar items for the Medium Explorer (e.g. 'Expand all',
  'Show features that are not yet installed').
- Better responsiveness in the Search View.
- Several bugfixes.


Changes between 2.1.2 and 2.1.3

- Fixed a major performance problem that appeard with JVM 1.4.x during
  dependency determination and search.
